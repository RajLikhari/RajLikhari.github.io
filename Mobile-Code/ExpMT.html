					<li>My personal website is the first real project I have taken on, I wanted to create this in order to showcase my skills, experience, and a little bit about myself! Also, the website uses only HTML and CSS. It was a tremendous amount of fun to create this website because it really let me be in control of what I want to do, where I want to do it, and allowed me to complete it on my own schedule. I can’t wait to continually add more information to the website and maybe create a new website which is even more modern and interactive!</li>
					<li id="project-header1">Photography API</li>
					<li>My Photography API is the newest project that I will be starting soon. I am deciding whether or not to create it owns independent website which has the API in it or implement it within this website in the Photography section. The purpose of this API is to give me experience with different frameworks of JavaScript such as Node.JS and Express.JS and teach me working knowledge of GET and PUT requests. Also, the purpose of this API is to be able to use my edited pictures within your own website for decoration and maybe teach people how to create APIs such as the one I will make. I’m extremely excited to start this project as it will be one of the first projects I have with JavaScript! </li>
					<li id="project-header1">SAE Ford Mustang</li>
					<li>As a member of A&M’s Society of Automotive Engineering First Man team, I have the chance to work on a 1994 Fox-Body Mustang. The purpose of the remodeling is to prepare the vehicle for a competitive endurance race which can last up to 12 hours. The work my team and I have done on the vehicle is gutting the entire vehicle such as removing seats and all interior pieces, disassembling the engine in order to diagnose critical damages, and sanding the vehicle down for paint. Due to COVID-19, the progress on the vehicle has been very slow however, once the impact of the virus is reduced, progress will undoubtedly advance rapidly. </li>
